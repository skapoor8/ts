## Using NX

1. creating workspace X
2. configure - apps and libs via nx.json X
3. creating apps and libs
4. starting and stopping apps

questions

1. why do libs need package.json
2. running scripts in packages from the project toplevel - rn running by going to project
3. issues when changing directory structure - expected path libs or something - issues was not running nx command line from project root
4. shared nodemodules vs separate by lib

## Using MikroORM

1. connecting
2. sharing entities? can't be done easily, object impedence mismatch
3. mikro config in db root
4. using cli with ts-node -> enable in config, less of a headache than compiling everything
5. migrations with cli
6. seeding data with cli
7. db dumps, imports and exports
